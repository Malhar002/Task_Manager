Privacy Policy

Effective date: 06 July 2023

Our Todo List app ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Todo List app for Android devices (the "App").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our App.

We do not collect any personal information when you use the App. The App does not require you to create an account or provide any personal details.

The App may, however, collect non-personal information such as device information, including the type of device you are using, the operating system version, and other diagnostic information. This information is used solely for the purpose of improving the functionality and performance of the App.

The App may use third-party services that may collect information for the purpose of improving the App's functionality and user experience. These services may collect anonymous usage statistics, crash reports, and other diagnostic information. The information collected by these services is used solely for analytical purposes, such as understanding how users interact with the App, identifying and fixing issues, and enhancing the overall performance and user experience. This information is anonymized and does not personally identify you. We take appropriate measures to ensure that these third-party services comply with strict confidentiality and data protection standards.

The App may contain links to external sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

The App does not use cookies or any similar technologies to track your usage.

The security of your personal information is important to us, but please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

The App is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can delete the information.

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
